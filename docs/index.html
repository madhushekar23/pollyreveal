					<h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
					<p><img src="images/Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg"/></p><p>
					</p><audio data-autoplay="" src="index.html.002.mp3"></audio><aside class="notes">
						Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.
						He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics.
						Einstein&#39;s work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
						Einstein is best known in popular culture for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc squared.
						He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.

					<h1>Marie Curie</h1>

						Marie Sklodowska Curie;, was a Polish and naturalized French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris.  She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

						Her achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity; a term that she coined; around techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium.

					<h1>Niels Bohr</h1>
					<p><img src="images/Niels_Bohr.jpg"/></p><p>
					</p><audio data-autoplay="" src="index.html.004.mp3"></audio><aside class="notes">
						Niels Henrik David Bohr was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.

						Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr&#39;s thinking in both science and philosophy.

					<h1>Henri Becquerel</h1>

					</p><audio data-autoplay="" src="index.html.005.mp3"></audio><aside class="notes">
						Antoine Henri Becquerel was a French physicist, Nobel laureate, and the first person to discover evidence of radioactivity. For work in this field he, along with Marie Curie and Pierre Curie, received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics. The SI unit for radioactivity, the becquerel (Bq), is named after him.

					<h1>Max PLanck</h1>
					<p><img src="images/Max_Planck.jpg"/></p><p>
					</p><audio data-autoplay="" src="index.html.006.mp3"></audio><aside class="notes">
						Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck, was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.  Planck made many contributions to theoretical physics, but his fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the originator of quantum theory, which revolutionized human understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. However, his name is also known on a broader academic basis, through the renaming in 1948 of the German scientific institution, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, as the Max Planck Society. The M P S now includes 83 institutions representing a wide range of scientific directions.
